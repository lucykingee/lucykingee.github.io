##Foodvision 101 Model Deployment##
•	Situation: Faced with the challenge of classifying 101 food categories using a limited dataset.
•	Task: Train and deploy a model on Hugging Face with a user-friendly interface for image uploads and classification.
•	Action: Utilized a Vision Transformer (VIT) model with transfer learning and used Gradio interface for easy image uploads and top-5 predictions.
•	Result: Achieved 85% classification accuracy, with reliable predictions via a cloud-based interface on Hugging Face.
•	Reflection: Improved skills in transfer learning, model deployment, and creating accessible tools for non-technical users.
