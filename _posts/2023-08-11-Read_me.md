NUGGET
Unstructured data is data you'll find outside of the traditional row and column structure (such as in an Excel spreadsheet or pandas DataFrame). Examples of unstructured data include images, audio, and natural language.
If you're working with these kinds of data sources, it's generally best to use deep learning, neural networks or transfer learning to gain insights out of them.
